# Recruitment and Compensation Diversity Report

## Summary
* In response to growing emphasis on workplace diversity, our company undertook a comprehensive analysis to assess its current diversity landscape. The primary objectives were to identify the most effective recruiting sources for diversity, uncover potential pay inequities, and evaluate the organization's overall diversity profile concerning race, gender, and age. Data visualization played a pivotal role in this analysis. Bar plots revealed wage disparities by gender in specific departments, with women in the Software Engineering department earning more on average, albeit with a smaller sample size. Scatter plots highlighted pay rate variations in the Admin Offices and Software Engineering departments. Age diversity was depicted using distribution plots, indicating a concentration of employees in their late 30s to early 40s. Histogram showcased gender distribution across recruitment sources and departments, revealing sources like newspaper/magazine and Indeed as more favorable for recruiting women. Key findings included Diversity Job Fair emerged as a cornerstone in diversifying Dental Magic. At IT/IS, people of two or more races are paid significantly less than other workers in the same job position. Women constituting 60% of the workforce, yet earning less on average than men. Most workers aged 60+ in Production work at lower-paid positions.

## Situation
* In the contemporary business landscape, there's a growing emphasis on fostering diversity and inclusion within organizations. Our company, like many others, recognizes the myriad benefits of a diverse workforce, from enhanced creativity to better financial performance. However, there have been concerns raised, both internally and from external stakeholders, about the current state of diversity within our organization. Questions have emerged about the effectiveness of our recruiting sources in promoting diversity, potential pay inequities across different departments, and the overall diversity profile of the company. Given the importance of these issues, both from an ethical standpoint and for the company's long-term success, there was a pressing need to conduct a comprehensive diversity analysis, focusing on race, gender, and age.

## Task

The main purposes of this project are: <BR>

* What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
* Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
* What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?

We will be analyzing each matter with regard to race, gender, and age.

## Action


## Result
**1. Which sources yield the best results for recruiting a diverse workforce?**

* An evaluation has shown that participating in the Diversity Job Fair is crucial for enhancing Dental Magic's diversity and should be further promoted. Most hires from Indeed and college recruitment initiatives belong to minority groups, whereas other sources predominantly attract Caucasian candidates, which warrants further investigation.

* The company falls short in achieving age diversity, with no recruitment source standing out in this regard.

**2. Does the company have any pay equity issues?**

* Within the IT/IS department, multiracial employees receive considerably less pay compared to their peers in the same roles, with no clear reason for this disparity.

* Overall, women earn less, especially in Production where they are the majority, and in Administrative roles where a significant gender pay gap exists. Moreover, employees over 60, particularly in Production, tend to hold lower-paying jobs.

**3. What does the diversity profile of the company look like?**

* Racially, whites are a majority, but job distribution among minorities is more equitable than national averages. Hispanics earn slightly more on average, while Native Americans or Alaska Natives earn less, although this is based on a small sample and cannot be definitively attributed to discrimination.

* Gender-wise, the company employs predominantly women, including its CEO, which is noteworthy in an employment landscape that typically favors men for leadership roles. The high number of women in Production is also significant. However, the company must address the gender pay gap that still exists.

* Age diversity is lacking, with only 5.2% of employees aged 60 or above, which is low compared to national figures. This is particularly concerning in the Software Engineering and Administrative departments with minimal representation of employees over 45, while the Sales department shows a better inclusion of older, well-compensated employees.
